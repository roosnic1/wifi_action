\label{sec:Zusammenfassung}
This is a paper about the development of a proof of concept for an university project. The goal was to implement an Android app that can execute certain predefined tasks when reaching or leaving a wifi network. Another part of this paper is the analysis of the density of wifis in cities as big as ZÃ¼rich. The app has implemented all the requirments defined in chapter \ref{sec:anforderungsanalyse} and is available on github.com\footnote{Github repository: \url{https://github.com/roosnic1/wifi_action}}.
